# Spotify Advanced SQL Project
Project Category: Advanced - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset">Click Here to get Dataset</a>
## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query perfomance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

## Project Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it's important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset constains attributes such as:
```Artist``` : The perfomer of the track.
```Track``` : The name of the song.
```Album``` : The album to which the track belongs.
```Album_type``` : The type of album (e.g., single or album)
various metrics such as ```Danceability```, ```Energy```, ```Loudness```, ```Tempo```, and more.
